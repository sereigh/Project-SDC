### Development

> My role in the remote team that developed Project-Catwalk was re-designing and implementing the client-facing features of the Questions & Answers Service.
>
> There was a unique need to display multiple pieces of relational data in a clean and user friendly way. I chose to display these data points in an accordion style UI to reduce scrolling and support user control.

The panel functionality is controlled with a queue-like function I implemented with Javascript, and supported by pure CSS properties and ternary operators that switch element class names to show or hide information based on user interaction.

> Check out [Operation](#Operation) for an overview of the services' functionality or the [Preview](#Preview) below for a demonstration of all Q & A features.
